Client-Side Development 2.2 - Angular application that helps with advertising horses on various websites

This project was part of the Client-Side Development course at Avans University, year 2, period 2. The goal was to create a CRUD application using Angular, based on a domain of my choice. The domain I chose was the advertising business, horse advertisement to be specific. The idea was based on a side job where I advertised horses on various websites. I wanted to create a system where I could keep track of what horses were placed on what websites to make sure that, when a horse was sold, they didn't remain on a forgotten website. 

This is the front-end of the application, made using Angular.
